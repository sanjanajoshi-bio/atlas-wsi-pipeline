## Modeling (In Progress)

This directory will contain baseline supervised and semi-supervised models
used for downstream analysis.

Current focus:
- Baseline tumor vs normal patch classification
- Encoder–decoder architectures for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly scoring

Model training and evaluation are being iterated on separately from the
preprocessing pipeline.
